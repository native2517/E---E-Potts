Auto Menu Title Module
----------------------
by Alex Bergin (alex.bergin@gmail.com)

This is a small module that enables the automatic population of the menu title field following changes made to the node title in an add or edit node form. It is designed to save time with data entry. The feature can be enabled or disabled on a per-content type basis.
